Day- 1

1. Java 8, OOP , SOLID principle

Why we use Java? What is Java?
Why?
C#, Go, Java = Static Programming language
- Static Programming language => String a = "Apple";
                                    a = 1; // can't assign number // eaay to handle the program of data
Java use in Enterprise project such as Banking domain important data - KBZ banking, ibanking, KBZ pay



Java vs Spring Boot

Java -> imigine like music language --- Shan, Eng, Burmese song = language

SpringBoot -> Rock, Pop, country song = framework

-------

Python and PHP = Dynamic Progamming language

String s = "appple';
s = 10; //can assign number
-------

What is JDK, JVM and JRE? this is main core concept in java
JDK = Java Development Kit -> InteliJ is for developer
JVM = Java Virtual Machine  -> Window OS , Mac OS , Linux OS (platform)=> write java code one time and run everywhere
JRE = Java Runtime Environment
when we deploy our jar file on Platform/ server we need jre to install
---------

    1.1: OOP
         1. Classes / Objects - Blueprint for Object/
            detail eg in real world, Human(name, age, address, phone number) -> Class
          Object -> Mg Mg, 27, Shan, 0923456
         2. Encapsulation -> hide data/ control and validate data.
         Prevent for outside/invalidate coming data
            eg. deposite / withdraw money from Kpay => topup phone bill like MPT

                Kpay - 500
                Topup - 1000

                if(top_amount <= balance)
                {
                    topup();
                }else{
                    throw Exception(...);
                }


         3. Inheritance -> Parent and child
         4. Polymorphism -> type changing
         5. Abstraction  -> enforce child to inplement like Parent do
--------
    1.2 SOLID principle ( Day -2)

    S -> Single Responsibility Principal, if one class need to compute only Responsibility
        eg.1.Payroll class-> should have related function
            - employee_payroll();

        eg.2.Report class
            - report();

        Employee class -> save(), payroll(), report() -> many Responsibility. One class should be have one function but need to do perfect
    O -> OCP Open for extension close for modification

        e.g Payroll class
            - employee_payroll(int salary_amount){
                salary_amount = 20,000;
            }; // In company ABC, boss wanna increate the employee salary;

    L -> Liskov Substitution can child object can replace parent reference
        Car {
            start();
        } // parent
        ElectricCare extend Car{
            start(String engin);
        }

    I -> Interface Segregation ->don't create useless interface, not use fat interface use thin interface
    eg. one interface shouldn't have many implementaion
    What is Interface?
        eg. AC, remote -> We can turn on from remote

    D -> Dependency Inversion-> create outside and parse object that call it

    A ->B , B -> C, create B from outside and pass the object B for A, C

2. Servlet, JSP

    What is Servlet?
    Servlet = server
    C:\Users\Nan Mo Kham>ncat google.com 80
        GET / HTTP/1.1

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Date: Sun, 04 Jan 2026 10:49:53 GMT
        Expires: -1
        Cache-Control: private, max-age=0
    JSP -> IU technology (Frontend technology: Angular, JavaScript, React...), form

3. MVC vs REST
    What is MVC?
    M= Model: hold data
    V= View: User interface
    C= Controller: Handle user action

4. RDBMS (SQL vs NoSQL)
    Relational Database Management System -> store in table connect with foreign
    NoSQL : Not only SQL

5. ORM vs JDBC
    JDBC
    What is ORM? other third party technology -> Hibernate, Mybetic, Ibetic
    Java store and work data in Object style but in our database store data like table and column
    Java -> ORM -> Database

6. DTO vs DAO
    DTO?-> eg. Student Mark/Grade, In student grade we have
    StudentGrade{ // store in database DAO
        String student_id; // STU001
        List<Subject> subjectList; // English, Science,...
        String status;
    }

    Subject{//store in database DAO
        String name; //English
        double mark;
    }

    //DTO response for client
    StudentGradeResponse{ // not store in database
        List<StudentGrade> studentGradeList;
    }

7. Dependency Injection - Spring support DI

8. JavaSE vs J2EE (now call Jakarta EE)
    JavaSE? use for standalone applicaion only one user can user per time
    J2EE? user thounsand of user can use the application

9. Synchronous vs Asynchronous
    Synchronous means= Each task must finish before the next one starts/ next task cannot start until current finishes. Java is Synchronous
    real world eg. Toilet and user
        user 1 enter Toilet after user1 done the other user can continue

    Asynchronous: Start a task and don’t wait for it to finish
    You can do other tasks at the same time
    in real world eg. Restaurant, waiter and customers
    when cutomers order food to waiter, waiter get order list and send noti to kicten
    and then this waiter go to other customers table and get other oder too.

    To Do : Please study Java8 and a little about Spring MVC vs Spring Boot
