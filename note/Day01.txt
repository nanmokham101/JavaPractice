1. Java 8, OOP , SOLID principle 

Why we use Java? What is Java? 
Why? 
C#, Go, Java = Static Programming language
- Static Programming language => String a = "Apple";
                                    a = 1; // can't assign number // eaay to handle the program of data
Java use in Enterprise project such as Banking domain important data - KBZ banking, ibanking, KBZ pay



Java vs Spring Boot

Java -> imigine like music language --- Shan, Eng, Burmese song = language 

SpringBoot -> Rock, Pop, country song = framework 

-------

Python and PHP = Dynamic Progamming language 

String s = "appple';
s = 10; //can assign number
-------

What is JDK, JVM and JRE? this is main core concept in java
JDK = Java Development Kit -> InteliJ is for developer 
JVM = Java Virtual Machine  -> Window OS , Mac OS , Linux OS (platform)=> write java code one time and run everywhere
JRE = Java Runtime Environment 
when we deploy our jar file on Platform/ server we need jre to install 
---------

    1.1: OOP 
         1. Classes / Objects - Blueprint for Object/
            detail eg in real world, Human(name, age, address, phone number) -> Class 
          Object -> Mg Mg, 27, Shan, 0923456 
         2. Encapsulation -> hide data/ control and validate data. 
         Prevent for outside/invalidate coming data
            eg. deposite / withdraw money from Kpay => topup phone bill like MPT

                Kpay - 500 
                Topup - 1000

                if(top_amount <= balance)
                {
                    topup();
                }else{
                    throw Exception(...);
                }


         3. Inheritance -> Parent and child 
         4. Polymorphism -> type changing
         5. Abstraction  -> enforce child to inplement like Parent do
--------

2. Servlet, JSP
3. MVC vs REST
4. ORM vs JDBC
5. DTO vs DAO
6. Dependency Injection
7. RDBMS (SQL vs NoSQL)
8. JavaSE vs J2EE (now call Jakarta EE)
9. Synonyms vs Asynchronous
